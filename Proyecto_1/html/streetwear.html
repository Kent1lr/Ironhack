                    <p class="text1">Here we enter categories that are often unclear to the uninitiated. Indeed, it's still easy these days to confuse streetwear with sportswear.</p>
                    <p class="text1">How can we tell them apart? Historically, sportswear has been influenced by sports such as golf and tennis, to which basketball, soccer, etc. have been added over time. Streetwear, on the other hand, more often takes up street-related codes: hip-hop movements, skateboarding, but also jazz and surf influences...</p>
                    <p class="text1">In fact, the lines are becoming thinner. In fact, streetwear has gone beyond its own codes to become a veritable "catch-all" whose boundaries blur at the whim of its followers' creative desires.</p>
                    <p class="text1">The introduction of chic pieces into looks, partnerships with haute couture houses... there's no stopping streetwear. So much so, in fact, that one wonders if streetwear hasn't become (Covid having helped a great deal) THE major stylistic force. At least among the under-40s.</p>
                    <p class="text2">A simple streetwear outfit to start with: a good sweatshirt, jeans and sneakers. And finally, a New Era cap.</p>
