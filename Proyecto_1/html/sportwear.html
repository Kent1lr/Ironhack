                    <p class="text1">If sportswear is so easily confused with streetwear, it's because it has followed almost the same trajectory.</p>
                    <p class="text1">In its early days, it was a simple urban variant of what athletes wore (or used to wear) on the playing field. Today, it's a veritable fashion trend, strongly influencing young people's style.</p>
                    <p class="text1">Yes, sportswear is fashionable. It's everywhere in the street, as a symbol of a youth that recognizes itself in its codes. NBA and soccer clubs are the standard-bearers.</p>
                    <p class="text1">But they are no longer alone. Fitness has also joined the game, thanks to the real boom it has experienced over the last 5/6 years, notably thanks to social networks. What were once only gym outfits worn by outcasts, are now being worn on the streets in a totally uninhibited way, becoming real everyday wear.</p>
                    <p class="text2">The iconic piece of this style: the famous sneaker, which aficionados snatch up for indecent prices.</p>
