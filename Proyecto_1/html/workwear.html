                    <p class="text1">In France, it's strongly linked to Parisian fashion and hipster circles. In the USA, it's a completely different story, as it's part of a folklore that's very much alive in "deep" America.</p>
                    <p class="text1">The fascinating thing about workwear is that it transcends categories that don't exist side by side, and makes its own the addition of the modern and the secular.</p>
                    <p class="text1">In other words, it takes the history and outfits of (manual) workers and makes them part of very style-conscious trends.</p>
                    <p class="text1">It's even infused where we least expect it. Could you name the second most workwear-friendly country after the USA? Japan! That's right.</p>
                    <p class="text2">When it comes to style, workwear is all about flannel or lumberjack shirts, selvedge jeans, big boots and the famous work jacket that Google will automatically return if you type in "workwear style"!</p>
